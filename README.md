## Under development

### [covid-19-survey-analysis](https://github.com/nathankchan/covid-19-survey-analysis) 

**Objective**: To characterize behavioural patterns in population-level self-reported survey data collected during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**Keywords**: R, COVID-19, pandemic, behavioural determinants, data cleaning & processing, outlier analysis, multiple imputation, multivariate analysis, correspondence analysis, generalized partial least squares, multivariate visualization

**Status**: Code required for analysis is complete; however, it needs to be refactored before being published on the repo. 

**To-do**: 
1. Refactor code for GPLS analysis.
2. Refactor code for multivariate analysis visualizations.
3. Create markdown report for reproducible analysis.
4. Finish documentation for github.

### [explainers](https://github.com/nathankchan/explainers)

**Objective**: To provide educational resources regarding quantitative analysis and related topics.

**Keywords**: explainers, reports, lectures, math, statistics, quantitative analysis, education

**Status**: Slide decks and reports need additional work before publishing

**To-do**:
1. Finish LaTeX report on n-nacci constants.

## Completed

### [shopify-ds-intern-challenge](https://github.com/nathankchan/shopify-ds-intern-challenge)

**Objective**: To characterize sales in a database and identify appropriate measures of central tendency.

**Keywords**: sales, average, outliers, arithmetic mean, median, mode, harmonic mean, geometric mean, interactive visualization and application

**Deliverables**:
1. [Analysis report](https://nathankchan.github.io/shopify-ds-intern-challenge/Analysis.html)
2. [Histogram-density plot viewer](https://nathankchan.shinyapps.io/Histogram-Density_Plot_Viewer/)

### [niviz-rater](https://github.com/nathankchan/niviz-rater)

**Objective**: To implement a YAML validator for a brain imaging visualization and quality control tool

**Keywords**: Python, metadata, collaborative hackathon project

## Planned

### ADNI analysis

**Objective**: To analyze neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurodegenerative patterns among participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

**Keywords**: R, Python, bash, neuroimaging, clinical trial, case-control matching, coarsened exact matching, mixed data, stratified analysis, linear mixed models, CMH statistics

**Status**: Project uses confidential patient data; need to think about ways to copy data for the purposes of code demonstration...

## Under development

### *[covid-19-survey-analysis](https://nathankchan.github.io/covid-19-survey-analysis/)*

**Objective**: To characterize behavioural patterns in population-level self-reported survey data collected during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**Keywords**: R, COVID-19, pandemic, behavioural determinants, data cleaning & processing, outlier analysis, multiple imputation, multivariate analysis, correspondence analysis, generalized partial least squares, multivariate visualization

**Status**: Code required for analysis is complete; however, it needs to be refactored before being published on the repo. 

**Deliverables**:
1. [Repository](https://github.com/nathankchan/covid-19-survey-analysis)
2. Reports
    * [Introduction](https://nathankchan.github.io/covid-19-survey-analysis/Analysis_part1.html)
    * [Data Extraction & Processing](https://nathankchan.github.io/covid-19-survey-analysis/Analysis_part2.html) 

**To-do**: 
1. Refactor code for GPLS analysis.
2. Refactor code for multivariate analysis visualizations.
3. Create markdown report for reproducible analysis.
4. Finish documentation for github.

### *[explainers](https://github.com/nathankchan/explainers)*

**Objective**: To provide educational resources regarding quantitative analysis and related topics.

**Keywords**: explainers, reports, lectures, math, statistics, quantitative analysis, education

**Status**: Slide decks and reports need additional work before publishing

**To-do**:

## Planned

### *ADNI analysis*

**Objective**: To analyze neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurodegenerative patterns among participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

**Keywords**: R, Python, bash, neuroimaging, clinical trial, case-control matching, coarsened exact matching, mixed data, stratified analysis, linear mixed models, CMH statistics

**Status**: Project uses confidential patient data; need to think about ways to copy data for the purposes of code demonstration...
